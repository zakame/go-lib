# zakame's Go Library

This started out as a practical means to learn about Go packages and
modules, but now these seem useful elsewhere:

- [cache](https://godoc.org/github.com/zakame/go-lib/cache): provides a
  na√Øve in-memory cache, yet safe for concurrent access
- [epochtime](https://godoc.org/github.com/zakame/go-lib/epochtime):
  provides an adapter for time.Time that accepts Unix epoch time as
  string, mainly for use in unmarshalling JSON to structs
